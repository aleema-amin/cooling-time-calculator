## 📘 Overview

This project is a command‑line Python application that calculates how long it takes for an object to cool in a given environment. It uses Newton’s Law of Cooling, allows users to estimate the cooling constant k, provides material presets, logs results to a file, and includes a full help/“About” menu explaining the physics behind the calculations.

This tool is designed for students, engineers, and anyone exploring thermodynamics in a practical, interactive way.

## ✨ Features

## 🌍 Why This Project Matters

Understanding cooling behaviour is essential in engineering fields such as:

- aerospace (thermal protection systems)  
- materials science  
- food safety  
- electronics cooling  
- environmental modelling  

This tool provides a simple, interactive way to explore real thermodynamic behaviour and understand how objects cool in real‑world environments.

## 🧠 The Science Behind It

This tool uses **Newton's Law of Cooling**, which models how an object cools relative to the temperature difference between the object and its surroundings.

### Core Equation

T(t) = T_env + (T_0 - T_env)e^-kt

Where:  
- T(t) = temperature at time t 
- T_0 = initial temperature  
- T_env = ambient temperature  
- k = cooling constant  
- t = time  

The program rearranges this equation to solve for time.

### Estimating the Cooling Constant

k = hA / mc

Where:  
- h = convective heat transfer coefficient  
- A = surface area  
- m = mass  
- c = specific heat capacity
